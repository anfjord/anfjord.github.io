<!--#How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was not as easy as the previous sessions. If you are very far apart when it comes to ambitions, it's difficult to work together. You have to have the same goals for the challenge to work and for it to be a rewarding experience.

#Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes. It's hard not to go into styling and keeping it to a blue-print. Wire framing help with building a visual backbone of your website.

#What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We were both pretty set on making something clean and simple at this stage.

#What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? --><header>
