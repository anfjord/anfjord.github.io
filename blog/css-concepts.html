        <h1>Padding on.. </h1>
        <p>This week we learned how to style our websites with CSS.</br>
           One important concept to understand is how you use padding, margin and border.</br>

        Lets imagine that all  HTML elements are wrapped in a box. </br>
        The box consists of: margins, borders, padding areas and the content (text, image etc)</br>

        The padding area of an element is the horizontal and vertical space that’s set around the actual content. </br>
        The border area extends the padding area to the area containing the borders of the element. </br>
        Margin is the space outside the border of that element. </br>
        If elements have no margins around them, they will bump right up against each other.</br>

        A good analogy that I found, was to think of padding like the space between your dining room table and wall (the border)
        and margin like your yard which is between you and your neighbor’s house.
