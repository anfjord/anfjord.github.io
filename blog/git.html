            On the first week of DBC we learned about Git and version control.</br>
            Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

            There are many advantages to working with version control.  </br>
            With version control you keep track of changes when you code, it helps you understand your code, discover bugs etc. </br>
            By using branches itâ€™s also a smooth way to test out new code without interfering in the master code.


            </p>
            <p>
            Git keeps track of all the changes made in the files that you have inside a git tracked folder. </br>
            And every time you save your project in Git, it's called a commit, it's like the program takes a picture of what  your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

            </p>
            <p>
            There is this other thing called Github, that shouldn't be confused with Git. </br>
            Github is a place to store and share you code ONLINE. It allows for others to see and collaborate on your code (at the same time!). It's a great way to organize team-work.

            </p>
