On the first week of DBC we learned about Git and version control. Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

There are many advantages to working with version control.  With version control you keep track of changes when you code, it helps you understand your code, discover bugs etc. By using branches itâ€™s also a smooth way to test out new code without interfering in the master code.

Git keeps track of all the changes made in the files that you have inside a git tracked folder. And every time you save your project in Git, it's called a commit, it's like the program takes a picture of what  your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.

</p>
<p>
There is this other thing called Github, that shouldn't be confused with Git. Github is a place to store and share you code ONLINE. It allows for others to see and collaborate on your code (at the same time!). It's a great way to organize team-work.
